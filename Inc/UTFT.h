  UTFT.h - Arduino/chipKit library support for Color TFT LCD Boards
  Copyright (C)2010-2012 Henning Karlsen. All right reserved

  This library is the continuation of my ITDB02_Graph, ITDB02_Graph16
  and RGB_GLCD libraries for Arduino and chipKit. As the number of
  supported display modules and controllers started to increase I felt
  it was time to make a single, universal library as it will be much
  easier to maintain in the future.

  Basic functionality of this library was origianlly based on the
  demo-code provided by ITead studio (for the ITDB02 modules) and
  NKC Electronics (for the RGB GLCD module/shield).

  This library supports a number of 8bit, 16bit and serial graphic
  displays, and will work with both Arduino and chipKit boards. For a
  full list of tested display modules and controllers, see the
  document UTFT_Supported_display_modules_&_controllers.pdf.

  When using 8bit and 16bit display modules there are some
  requirements you must adhere to. These requirements can be found
  in the document UTFT_Requirements.pdf.
  There are no special requirements when using serial displays.

  You can always find the latest version of the library at
  http://electronics.henningkarlsen.com/

  If you make any modifications or improvements to the code, I would
  appreciate that you share the code with me so that I might include
  it in the next release. I can be contacted through
  http://electronics.henningkarlsen.com/contact.php.
